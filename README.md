# python

Just some random code to practice python

File Descriptions:
------------------

+ GoogleDirectionsAPI.py - Uses directions API from Google Maps to get a start point and end point from a user, then display the route data back to the user with total distance and duration of the route and distance and duration of each step in the route.

+ reverse.py - Creates a "shell" for the user to enter 6 commands; 3 normal and 3 reverse. This was just to practice creating lists from strings, using for loops, and manipulating lists and data.
